DISCLAIMER:
You should follow this procedure if and only if you have successfully generated MM params for your system.
If you haven't, generate those first using mm_gen_procedure_revised.txt

1. copy the full params file generated at the end of mm_param_gen procedure here (*full.prm, let's say)
2. python formatParams.py *full.prm (generates qchem_formated.prm)

3. copy the txyz file formatted with newAtomtypes and xyz file for your system
4. create *.cart.xyz and *.cart.txyz with just the coordinates and connectivity (no total atom numbers and empty lines)

5. ./mergeconnectivity.sh *.cart.txyz *.cart.xyz (generates coords.txt, connectivity.txt, *merged.xyz)

Now, you have everything that you need to generate the qchem input file.
6. Find out atoms in QM and MM region. You can do this manually as well but can also be done using script
    list_qm_atoms.py. It uses pyGSM module so you have to load an environment which has pygsm module in it.
    You can create an environment by yourself (conda create -n pygsmenv python=3.9, clone the pyGSM github repo
    and pip install -e.) or load an existing environment with pyGSM (conda activate ~soumikd/.conda/envs/pygsmenv)

    6.1. Once you load an environment, python list_qm_atoms.py *.xyz (not .cart.xyz)\
    6.2. Enter QM border atom indexes with space (border of atoms at the reactive site)
    6.3. Enter MM border atom indexes with space (border of non-reactive atoms)
    6.4. Copy the atom indices printed in QM region in sample.inp (file with $rem section)

7. cat sample.inp qchem_formated.prm molec.inp > sample.qmmm.inp
8. open *merged.xyz and enter total atom number and an empty line after, save that change
9. python qmmm_inpgen.py sample.qmmm.inp *_merged.xyz q001.**.xyz.inp

Submit q001.**.xyz.inp through a SLURM script like any typical Q-Chem job

** For any new xyz file (same system), MM params will be unchanged. Just you have to make the txyz file for it and create qchem input using the following procedure
i. source ~/bin/setupbcat
ii. babel file.xyz file.txyz
iii. python gen_txyz.py file.txyz matched_atoms.prm newfile.txyz
iv. create *.cart.xyz and *.cart.txyz with just the coordinates and connectivity (no total atom numbers and empty lines)
v. ./mergeconnectivity.sh *.cart.txyz *.cart.xyz (generates coords.txt, connectivity.txt, *merged.xyz)
vi. open *merged.xyz and enter total atom number and an empty line after, save that change
vii. python qmmm_inpgen.py sample.qmmm.inp *_merged.xyz q00n.**.xyz.inp
