babel file.xyz file.mol2        # that is for cgenff
babel file.xyz file.txyz # that is for tinker format and connectivity

module load cgenff/2018.2

cgenff -a -f <outfile.rtf> file.mol2 – produce all parameters from cgenFF36 without LG

from rtf file get atoms to new file "tmpAtoms.prm" (charmm types and charges)
sort -u tmpAtoms.prm  > atomTypes.prm (here also need newTypes for further steps)
than sort them sort -u tmpAtoms.prm in format "CharmmType" to file "lgAtoms" (only list of unique charmTypes)

use script getLG.sh lgAtoms.prm allLG_cgenff36.prm(with removed everything except LG)
create new prm file with FF params and atom section
insert charges from uniqueAtoms.prm
develop new atomtypes based on charmm type and charge
insert charges and vdw

format atomtypes.txt "CharmType Charge newType"
transfer BONDS, ANGLES and DIHEDRALS to file param.rtf. format each line with “bond”, “angle” and “torsion”
Then, to match CHARMM type with new types use python match_atoms.py atomTypes.txt (that read atoms.prm)
Copy new atomTypes from matched_atoms.prm to txyz file
Modify keyfile and run tinker:
./tinkerMinim.sh file.txyz > out.log to get list of needed  bond, angles, torsions
Leave only bonds, angles, torsions in out.log
Then, use python convTypes.py atomTypes.txt param.rtf to get all params
./combParams.sh file.prm – to combine all generated parameters in one file (also sort parameters to exclude repeating parameters)
